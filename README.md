# -Automaton-Simulator
Built an interactive Automaton Simulator using Python and Tkinter. This tool lets users simulate and visualize both DFA and NFA in an intuitive and dynamic way!

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:

Define number of states, alphabet, start and final states

Enter transitions manually (supports Îµ-transitions for NFA)

Auto-generate animated state diagrams

Step-by-step input simulation with visual highlights

ðŸ“¸ Export the diagram as an image

ðŸ§¹ Easily reset for new simulations
